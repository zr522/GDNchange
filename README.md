# GDN

Code implementation for : [Graph Neural Network-Based Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series(AAAI'21)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06947.pdf)


# Installation
### Requirements
* Python >= 3.6
* cuda == 10.2
* [Pytorch==1.5.1](https://pytorch.org/)
* [PyG: torch-geometric==1.5.0](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html)


### Notices:
* The first column in .csv will be regarded as index column. 
* The column sequence in .csv don't need to match the sequence in list.txt, we will rearrange the data columns according to the sequence in list.txt.
* test.csv should have a column named "attack" which contains ground truth label(0/1) of being attacked or not(0: normal, 1: attacked)

## Run
```
    # using gpu
    bash run.sh <gpu_id> <dataset>

    # or using cpu
    bash run.sh cpu <dataset>
```
You can change running parameters in the run.sh.

# Others
SWaT and WADI datasets can be requested from [iTrust](https://itrust.sutd.edu.sg/)
